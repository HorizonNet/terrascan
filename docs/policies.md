# Policies

Terrascan policies are written using the [Rego policy language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). With each rego policy a JSON "rule" file is included which defines metadata for the policy. Policies included within Terrascan are stored in the [pkg/policies/opa/rego](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan/tree/master/pkg/policies/opa/rego) directory.

## Rule JSON file

The rule files follow this naming convention: `<cloud-provider>.<resource-type>.<rule-category>.<severity>.<next-available-rule-number>.json`

Here's an example of the contents of a rule file:

``` json
{
    "name": "unrestrictedIngressAccess",
    "file": "unrestrictedIngressAccess.rego",
    "template_args": {
        "prefix": ""
    },
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "description": " It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access",
    "reference_id": "AWS.SecurityGroup.NetworkSecurity.High.0094",
    "category": "Network Ports Security",
    "version": 2
}
```
